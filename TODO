* Add new server/request button (should be available when no servers/requests
  are defined)
* Some way of inserting whole sections of headers
* Add bucket (container for sequences) -- should inter-bucket sequencing be
  allowed somehow?
* Maybe split the request a bit more? Separate headers, method, body?
* Response validation
